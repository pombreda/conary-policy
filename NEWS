Changes in 1.0.29:
  o New Features:
    * The ResolveFileDependencies policy now logs each translated
      requirement for aid in debugging. (CNP-198)

  o Bug Fixes:
    * NormalizeInitscriptContents now properly modifies script contents
      when initdir is /etc/rc.d/init.d (CNP-193)
    * FixupMultilibPaths now ignores all debuginfo paths.  Previously,
      if a recipe implemented debuginfo handling instead of leaving it
      to the Strip policy, the FixupMultilibPaths policy would
      incorrectly move debuginfo files. (CNP-201)
    * The NormalizePythonInterpreterVersion policy no longer incorrectly
      considers /usr/bin/python-config to be a python interpreter.
      (CNP-194)
    * ResolveFileDependencies was not being run on derived packages
      (CNP-202)

Changes in 1.0.28:
  o New Features:
    * Changed to express dependencies on initscripts functions via a file
      dependency instead of a trove dependency; the ResolveFileDependencies
      policy changes to the proper trove dependency. (CNP-191)

  o Bug Fixes:
    * A bug that caused some file dependencies to not be resolved to trove
      dependencies correctly has been fixed. (CNP-190)

Changes in 1.0.27:
  o New Features:
    * All destdir policies have been audited, and modified as necessary,
      to correctly handle capsules, in preparation for enabling destdir
      policies for capsules. (CNY-3320)
    * The new WarnScriptSharedLibrary policy looks at capsule scripts
      for possible instances of modifying the ld.so.conf, when used
      with Conary 2.1.2 or later. (CNP-185)

Changes in 1.0.26:
  o New Features:
    * When "file:" requirements are not not explicitly met by
      "file:" provides but the path exists in a trove, the new
      ResolveFileDependencies policy replaces the unsatisfied
      "file:" requirements with "trove:" requirements. (CNP-184)
    * The XinetdConfigRequires policy now creates file: dependencies
      instead of trove: dependencies by default, depending on the
      ResolveFileDependencies policy to change to trove: dependencies
      on platforms for which the /usr/sbin/xinetd path is not 
      explicitly provided. (CNP-183)

Changes in 1.0.25:
  o New Features:
    * Policies have been made capsule-aware and assume that the capsule
      will handle essentially all operations involving files in capsules.
      (PFM-506)
    * The RemoveBootstrapTroveDependencies policy removes trove dependencies
      that are not satisfied within the packages being built as a bootstrap
      because they may be computed against an incompatibly-named set of
      host packages. (PFM-506)
    * The PHPRequires policy now reports adding dependencies. (CNP-181)

Changes in 1.0.24:
  o New Features:
    * Libraries (ELF files containing DT_SONAME entries, not symbolic
      links) with file names ending in .so (instead of .so.something)
      are now tagged as shared libraries. (CNP-175)
    * TagLocale no longer looks at files in %(debuglibdir)s or
      %(debugsrcdir)s, since it would only complain about them and
      ignore them anyway. (CNP-177)

Changes in 1.0.23:
  o New Features:
    * The NormalizePythonInterpreterVersion policy has been modified to
      apply to all python scripts, regardless of whether they are
      executable, so that it applies to python modules as well as
      scripts. (CNP-170)
    * When moving info files, specify the full destination path; shutil.move
      has changed behavior in python 2.6 (CNP-173)

  o Bug Fixes:
    * A bug in SymlinkTargetRequires that caused a traceback when a
      symlink path contained a special regex character, such as +, has
      been fixed. (CNP-169)
    * A bug in PHPRequires policy that caused builds to fail or take an
      extremely long time to complete when both php and php5 were available
      has been fixed. (CNP-174)

Changes in 1.0.22:
  o New Features:
    * PythonEggs now allows directories that end in .egg to be packaged.
      (CNP-148)
    * The NormalizePythonEggs has been added. It automatically unpacks
      python .egg files that are placed in standard python module locations.
      The resulting directory is put in place of the .egg file. (CNP-149)
    * The SymlinkTargetRequires policy has been added. This policy will
      supress the DanglingSymlinks policy in favor of adding requires when
      appropriate. (CNP-130)
    * The PHPRequires policy now caches negative results. (CNP-164)
    * The PHPRequires policy now looks for binaries named "php5" as well
      as "php".  Previous PHP5 handling looked only for packages named
      "php5" but still expected to see binaries named "php". (CNP-165)
    * The ResetKeyValueMetadata policy has been added. It selectively
      deletes certain key-value metadata fields. (CNY-2983)

  o Bug Fixes:
    * A bug causing PHPRequires to fail if buildRequires are not present
      in the repository has been fixed. (CNP-160)

Changes in 1.0.21:
  o Bug Fixes:
    * A bug causing PHPRequires to fail in rMake has been fixed. (CNP-154)

Changes in 1.0.20:
  o New Features:
    * The PHPRequires policy has been added.  It identifies PHP files and
      when possible automatically adds an appropriate requirement based
      on the most appropriate PHP interpreter found on your system,
      buildRequires, or installLabelPath. (CNY-145)

Changes in 1.0.19:
  o New Features:
    * RequireChkconfig has been modified to handle new style init scripts.
      It now warns instead of errors on failure. (CNP-109)
    * The NormalizeLibrarySymlinks policy no longer attemps to run
      ldconfig from inside the package when cross-compiling. (CNP-140)
    * The EnforceStaticLibBuildRequirements policy now falls back to
      looking at shared libraries for cases where configure depends on
      a library existing, but only a shared library exists and no packaged
      file is linked against the shared library. (CNP-132)
    * The TagLocale policy has been added to tag locale files with a
      special path-derived tag of the form locale(localename). (CNP-138)

  o Bug Fixes:
    * A bug causing NormalizeInitscriptContents to fail if the target of
      a symlink didn't exist has been fixed. (CNP-129)
    * A bug causing PkgConfigRequires to fail if the destdir is a symlink
      has been fixed (CNP-131).
    * Setting a different prefix will no longer cause the Strip policy
      and several Normalize policies to traceback. (CNP-141)
    * NormalizeInfoPages handles file magic better to cover corner cases.
      (CNP-135)
    * The Strip policy no longer traces back if an ELF file is found but
      strip or eu-strip is not installed. (CNP-143)

Changes in 1.0.18:
  o Bug Fixes:
    * ConfigLogBuildRequirements caused builds to fail when encountering
      a line ending in "result:  " (two or more trailing spaces)
      while processing a config.log file.  This is corrected. (CNP-128)

Changes in 1.0.17:
  o New Features:
    * Description and Licenses policies can now be used to set
      metadata information for troves. (CNY-2715)
    * The RequireChkconfig policy now accepts empty lines in the
      chkconfig header. (CNP-81)
    * The new HttpdConfigRequires policy adds dependencies on
      /usr/sbin/httpd for all /etc/httpd/conf.d/*.conf files. (CNP-110)
    * The FixObsoletePaths policy has been modified to run before
      AutoDoc. It will now delete empty Obsolete paths rather than
      attempting to move them. (CNP-70)
    * The RemoveNonPackageFiles policy has been modifed to run before
      most policies designed to Normalize filenames in order to reduce
      the occurrence of non-package files being masked. (CNP-122)
    * Moved VersionConflicts from Conary to conary-policy and removed
      default exceptions. (CNY-2716)

Changes in 1.0.16:
  o New Features:
    * Policies now work with more recent versions of Conary (2.0.12
      and later) so that Conary can warn about possibly excessive
      buildRequires elements. (CNY-2232)
    * The new EnforceLocalizationBuildRequirements policy warns that
      gettext:devel and intltool:runtime are required if POTFILES.in
      exists. (CNP-115)
    * The EnforceConfigLogBuildRequirements has been expanded to look
      for header files and static libraries mentioned in config.log
      files, as well as more binaries. (CNP-35, CNP-123)


Changes in 1.0.15:
  o New Features:
    * The AutoSharedLibrary policy finds /etc/ld.so.conf.d/*.conf files
      and tells the SharedLibrary policy that the directories mentioned in
      those files contain shared libraries. (CNP-108)
    * Python *egg-info/requires.txt files are now inspected for suggested
      buildRequires additions. (CNP-102)
    * The new EnforceStaticLibBuildRequirements policy examines the output
      of the build process for linking to libraries that are not included
      among the shared libraries required by the package but are included
      on the system, and suggests additional buildRequires for those
      libraries. (CNP-120)

  o Bug Fixes:
    * An error causing PkgConfigRequires to traceback when handling
      requirement paths involving symlinks has been fixed. (CNP-119)

Changes in 1.0.14:
  o New Features:
    * Policies that move files in destdir now track path translations
      so files will end up in the correct package or component. (CNY-1679)
    * The XinetdConfigRequires policy has been added to enforce a requirement
      on xinetd when a configuration file with "disabled = no" is deployed
      in the /etc/xinetd.d/ directory. (CNP-93)
    * The PkgConfigRequires policy has been added to represent the
      internal dependencies expressed by pkg-config files. (CNP-93)

Changes in 1.0.13:
  o New Features:
    * The EnforceCILBuildRequires policy now ensures that the build
      requirements include 'mono:devel' if there are any CIL dependencies
      found.  The mono:devel package is required to discover CIL
      dependencies. (CNP-91)
    * When determining build requirements based on dependencies, :devel
      or :devellib components are preferred to :lib components for all
      dependency types, not just soname: dependencies.
    * /usr/bin/gfortran is now accepted as a name for the fortran
      compiler when guessing about false positives in config.log
      output. (CNP-58)
    * Log-based buildRequires policies (for config.log and CMakeCache
      files) consider :devel, :devellib, and :lib as a set, choosing
      the best component to recommend in that order. (CNP-105)
    * The NormalizePythonInterpreterVersion policy now can be told
      to make specific version mappings that override its heuristics,
      which is necessary in particular to build multiple python
      versions which can co-exist on the same system. (CNP-104)

Changes in 1.0.12:
  o New Features:
    * The _enforceBuildRequirements superclass now handles correctly
      having multiple packages with different names provide the same
      dependency required for a build requirement.  Previously, it
      only handled having multiple components of the same package
      provide the same dependency. (CNP-97)
    * The new NormalizePythonInterpreterVersion policy ensures that
      whenever possible, version-specific python interpreter paths
      are used. (CNP-99)
    * The NormalizeInitscriptContents no longer fails when a file in
      %(initdir)s is a link to a file outside of %(initdir)s. (CNP-101)
    * NormalizeInterpreterPaths now attempts to normalize more interpreter 
      paths - including those that look in /local/ for interpreters and 
      those that point to non-existant paths. (CNP-100)
    * The new EnforceCMakeCacheBuildRequirements policy recognizes
      potential buildRequirements based on CMakeCache.txt files as
      produced by the cmake tool.  Thanks to Pavel Volkovitskiy for
      implementing this feature. (CNP-67)

Changes in 1.0.11:
  o New Features:
    * Initial support for derived packages (experimental) has been added
      to appropriate policies. (CNP-73)

Changes in 1.0.10:
  o New Features:
    * The WorldWriteableExecutables policy warning message has been
      changed to be more accurate.
    * AutoDoc now enforces a mode of 0644 on files it adds to %(thisdocdir)s
      (CNP-43)
    * The new FixBuilddirSymlink policy has been added to fix symlinks
      that include the builddir. (CNP-48)
    * When multiple components provide a dependency that is discovered
      to be missing from the buildRequires list, dependencies between
      those components are investigated to determine which is the
      best dependency to suggest.  This will cause foo:devel to be
      suggested instead of providing a choice between foo:devel and
      foo:devellib. (CNP-60)
    * Now that Conary records the transitive closure of the buildRequires
      list, Enforce*BuildRequires inspects that transitive closure,
      eliminating unnecessary and redundant suggestions. (CNP-61)
    * The pam_stack module is now deprecated, so the NormalizePamConfig
      policy now changes to the preferred include mechanism by default.
      (CNP-42)
    * If Conary is new enough (1.0.41/1.1.14 or newer), Conary will now
      report if files that provide use flags are not included in the
      buildRequires list. (CNP-44)
    * All pkgconfig files are moved to be multilib-safe. (CNP-55)
    * Policy now fails on paths of /usr/usr (CNP-46).
    * Broken symlinks are now removed from the build dir after an error has
      been logged so that policies which check file contents are not confused
      by the broken symlink (CNP-59).
    * Packagers which place things into /usr/local will now recieve a warning
      stating that /usr/local is intended for non-managed files. (CNP-13)
    * A new policy, FixObsoletePaths, will now try to move files to the 
      correct place automatically, and log an error if it is unable to do so.
      The previous behaviour was for ObsoletePaths to log an error and not
      try to correct the issue. For compatability, an ObsoletePaths stub
      has been retained.
    * Manpages which contain their catagory in their filename will now be
      moved to the correct location if they exist in %(mandir)s and not
      %(mandir)s/category/. (CNP-5)
    * Manpages which were placed in directories such as /usr/share/man/1 will
      now be moved to their correct location: /usr/share/man/man1 (CNP-4)

  o Bug Fixes:
    * Calling SharedLibrary with bad arguments will no longer cause a traceback.
      (CNP-45)

Changes in 1.0.9:
  o New Features:
    * The AutoDoc policy now includes LICENSE.txt and NOTICE.txt files,
      since those names are common in Java packages. (CNP-29)
    * The NonMultilibComponent policy now considers only files, not
      directories. (CNP-39)
    * The NormalizeInitscriptContents policy now ignores directories.
      (CNP-41)

Changes in 1.0.8:
  o New Features:
    * Enforce*BuildRequirements now provides some more explanation about
      what is wrong when dependencies are not resolved in the system
      database or within a package, and gives specific instructions about
      how to handle the common case where binaries are built incorrectly.
      (CNP-15)
    * The WarnWriteable policy now does not warn about group-writeable
      files if the group in question is "root". (CNP-24)

  o Bug Fixes:
    * A bug that caused a traceback when attempting to make a symlink
      that points to the directory which contains it a relative symlink
      has been fixed. (CNP-28)

Changes in 1.0.7:
  o New Features:
    * Enforce*BuildRequirements regular expression exceptions now
      function with the correct sense. (CNP-14)

  o Bug Fixes:
    * A bug in NormalizePamConfig that would change pam files pointed
      to by symlinks in /etc/pam.d to have permissions 0777.  This would
      cause conary to fail to build the package.
    * A bug in Enforce*BuildRequirements that caused it to suggest
      overly aggressive and unnecessary build requirements, introduced
      in conary-policy 1.0.5, has been fixed. (CNP-12)

Changes in 1.0.6:
  o New Features:
    * CheckSonames no longer suggests calling r.Ldconfig, because
      the NormalizeLibrarySymlinks policy will automatically take
      care of every case where CheckSonames could have suggested
      calling r.Ldconfig.
    * CheckSonames will warn about shared libraries that have a
      SONAME that matches the name of an actual file instead of a
      symlink only once, and it will print a more helpful message
      as information rather than as a warning.

  o Bug Fixes:
    * A bug that caused the new interpreter checking behavior in
      EnforceBuildRequirements to traceback in many situations has
      been fixed.

Changes in 1.0.5:
  o New Features:
    * Enforce*BuildRequirements now enforce that interpreters for
      scripts are listed as build requirements. (CNP-1)
    * Strip now raises an exception if debuginfo will fail because
      the buildPath was too short to modify path references in
      binary files.  Before, it silently disabled debuginfo.
    * Strip is no longer run for bootstrap builds, in order to ease
      debugging bootstrap builds.

Changes in 1.0.4:
  o New Features:
    * NormalizePamConfig can now handle read-only /etc/pam.d files.

Changes in 1.0.3:
  o New Features:
    * Enforce*BuildRequirements now take regular expressions for
      exceptions, as well as literal strings.
    * All suggested additions to buildRequires are coalesced via the
      reportMissingBuildRequires policy, when run with a Conary new
      enough to provide that policy (1.0.13 or later) (CNY-349).
    * NormalizeLibrarySymlinks has a clearer message when ldconfig
      adds files to a directory, and the message is informational
      rather than a warning, since depending on NormalizeLibrarySymlinks
      instead of calling r.Ldconfig() explicitly is generally preferred.

  o Bug Fixes:
    * DanglingSymlinks no longer reports all symbolic links as dangling
      symlinks when the buildpath contains a symbolic link (RPL-308).

Changes in 1.0.2:
  o New Features:
    * The warning previously generated for "bad RPATH entries" (that is,
      entries starting with the destdir, the builddir, /tmp, or /var/tmp)
      has been changed to an error.

Changes in 1.0.1:
  o New Features:
    * CheckDesktopFiles now merely warns about missing icon files
      instead of raising an error; raising an error works very poorly
      because it adds too many false dependencies.
    * More policies have explicit ordering constraints added.
    * The documentation has been extensively updated.

Changes in 1.0:
  o New Features:
    * Added the new PythonEggs policy which prevents packaging python
      .egg files and explains how to fix the problem.
    * Sped up EnforceConfigLogBuildRequirements for the case where there
      are no config.log files.
    * "Icon=" lines are now ignored in .desktop files.

Changes in 0.90.2:
  o New Features:
    * Made the IgnoredSetuid policy work after ExcludeDirectories has
      been run.
    * DanglingSymlinks no longer complains if you add a symlink between 
      components where the source component requires the target

Changes in 0.90.1:
  o New Features:
    * Added NormalizeInitscriptContents policy to fix bad paths in
      initscripts and add necessary dependencies on initscripts:runtime
    * Changed from debug to info level logging

Changes in 0.90.0 (initial version):
  o New Features:
    * Split policy out from Conary
    * Note that conary-policy versions do not necessarily track Conary versions
