Changes in 1.0.10:
  o The WorldWriteableExecutables policy warning message has been
    changed to be more accurate.
  o AutoDoc now enforces a mode of 0644 on files it adds to %(thisdocdir)s
    (CNP-43)
  o The new FixBuilddirSymlink policy has been added to fix symlinks
    that include the builddir. (CNP-48)
  o When multiple components provide a dependency that is discovered
    to be missing from the buildRequires list, dependencies between
    those components are investigated to determine which is the
    best dependency to suggest.  This will cause foo:devel to be
    suggested instead of providing a choice between foo:devel and
    foo:devellib. (CNP-60)
  o Now that Conary records the transitive closure of the buildRequires
    list, Enforce*BuildRequires inspects that transitive closure,
    eliminating unnecessary and redundant suggestions. (CNP-61)
  o The pam_stack module is now deprecated, so the NormalizePamConfig
    policy now changes to the preferred include mechanism by default.
    (CNP-42)
  o If Conary is new enough (1.0.41/1.1.14 or newer), Conary will now
    report if files that provide use flags are not included in the
    buildRequires list. (CNP-44)
  o All pkgconfig files are moved to be multilib-safe. (CNP-55)

Changes in 1.0.9:
  o The AutoDoc policy now includes LICENSE.txt and NOTICE.txt files,
    since those names are common in Java packages. (CNP-29)
  o The NonMultilibComponent policy now considers only files, not
    directories. (CNP-39)
  o The NormalizeInitscriptContents policy now ignores directories.
    (CNP-41)

Changes in 1.0.8:
  o Enforce*BuildRequirements now provides some more explanation about
    what is wrong when dependencies are not resolved in the system
    database or within a package, and gives specific instructions about
    how to handle the common case where binaries are built incorrectly.
    (CNP-15)
  o The WarnWriteable policy now does not warn about group-writeable
    files if the group in question is "root". (CNP-24)
  o A bug that caused a traceback when attempting to make a symlink
    that points to the directory which contains it a relative symlink
    has been fixed. (CNP-28)

Changes in 1.0.7:
  o Enforce*BuildRequirements regular expression exceptions now
    function with the correct sense. (CNP-14)
  o A bug in NormalizePamConfig that would change pam files pointed
    to by symlinks in /etc/pam.d to have permissions 0777.  This would
    cause conary to fail to build the package.
  o A bug in Enforce*BuildRequirements that caused it to suggest
    overly aggressive and unnecessary build requirements, introduced
    in conary-policy 1.0.5, has been fixed. (CNP-12)

Changes in 1.0.6:
  o CheckSonames no longer suggests calling r.Ldconfig, because
    the NormalizeLibrarySymlinks policy will automatically take
    care of every case where CheckSonames could have suggested
    calling r.Ldconfig.
  o CheckSonames will warn about shared libraries that have a
    SONAME that matches the name of an actual file instead of a
    symlink only once, and it will print a more helpful message
    as information rather than as a warning.
  o A bug that caused the new interpreter checking behavior in
    EnforceBuildRequirements to traceback in many situations has
    been fixed.

Changes in 1.0.5:
  o Enforce*BuildRequirements now enforce that interpreters for
    scripts are listed as build requirements. (CNP-1)
  o Strip now raises an exception if debuginfo will fail because
    the buildPath was too short to modify path references in
    binary files.  Before, it silently disabled debuginfo.
  o Strip is no longer run for bootstrap builds, in order to ease
    debugging bootstrap builds.

Changes in 1.0.4:
  o NormalizePamConfig can now handle read-only /etc/pam.d files.

Changes in 1.0.3:
  o Enforce*BuildRequirements now take regular expressions for
    exceptions, as well as literal strings.
  o All suggested additions to buildRequires are coalesced via the
    reportMissingBuildRequires policy, when run with a Conary new
    enough to provide that policy (1.0.13 or later) (bz #869).
  o NormalizeLibrarySymlinks has a clearer message when ldconfig
    adds files to a directory, and the message is informational
    rather than a warning, since depending on NormalizeLibrarySymlinks
    instead of calling r.Ldconfig() explicitly is generally preferred.
  o DanglingSymlinks no longer reports all symbolic links as dangling
    symlinks when the buildpath contains a symbolic link (bz #856).

Changes in 1.0.2:
  o The warning previously generated for "bad RPATH entries" (that is,
    entries starting with the destdir, the builddir, /tmp, or /var/tmp)
    has been changed to an error.

Changes in 1.0.1:
  o CheckDesktopFiles now merely warns about missing icon files
    instead of raising an error; raising an error works very poorly
    because it adds too many false dependencies.
  o More policies have explicit ordering constraints added.
  o The documentation has been extensively updated.

Changes in 1.0:
  o Added the new PythonEggs policy which prevents packaging python
    .egg files and explains how to fix the problem.
  o Sped up EnforceConfigLogBuildRequirements for the case where there
    are no config.log files.
  o "Icon=" lines are now ignored in .desktop files.

Changes in 0.90.2:
  o Made the IgnoredSetuid policy work after ExcludeDirectories has
    been run.
  o DanglingSymlinks no longer complains if you add a symlink between 
    components where the source component requires the target

Changes in 0.90.1:
  o Added NormalizeInitscriptContents policy to fix bad paths in
    initscripts and add necessary dependencies on initscripts:runtime
  o Changed from debug to info level logging

Changes in 0.90.0 (initial version):
  o Split policy out from Conary
  o Note that conary-policy versions do not necessarily track Conary versions
