Changes in 1.0.12:
  o The _enforceBuildRequirements superclass now handles correctly
    having multiple packages with different names provide the same
    dependency required for a build requirement.  Previously, it
    only handled having multiple components of the same package
    provide the same dependency. (CNP-97)
  o The new NormalizePythonInterpreterVersion policy ensures that
    whenever possible, version-specific python interpreter paths
    are used. (CNP-99)
  o The NormalizeInitscriptContents no longer fails when a file in
    %(initdir)s is a link to a file outside of %(initdir)s. (CNP-101)

Changes in 1.0.11:
  o Initial support for derived packages (experimental) has been added
    to appropriate policies. (CNP-73)

Changes in 1.0.10:
  o The WorldWriteableExecutables policy warning message has been
    changed to be more accurate.
  o AutoDoc now enforces a mode of 0644 on files it adds to %(thisdocdir)s
    (CNP-43)
  o The new FixBuilddirSymlink policy has been added to fix symlinks
    that include the builddir. (CNP-48)
  o When multiple components provide a dependency that is discovered
    to be missing from the buildRequires list, dependencies between
    those components are investigated to determine which is the
    best dependency to suggest.  This will cause foo:devel to be
    suggested instead of providing a choice between foo:devel and
    foo:devellib. (CNP-60)
  o Now that Conary records the transitive closure of the buildRequires
    list, Enforce*BuildRequires inspects that transitive closure,
    eliminating unnecessary and redundant suggestions. (CNP-61)
  o The pam_stack module is now deprecated, so the NormalizePamConfig
    policy now changes to the preferred include mechanism by default.
    (CNP-42)
  o If Conary is new enough (1.0.41/1.1.14 or newer), Conary will now
    report if files that provide use flags are not included in the
    buildRequires list. (CNP-44)
  o All pkgconfig files are moved to be multilib-safe. (CNP-55)
  o Policy now fails on paths of /usr/usr (CNP-46).
  o Broken symlinks are now removed from the build dir after an error has
    been logged so that policies which check file contents are not confused
    by the broken symlink (CNP-59).
  o Packagers which place things into /usr/local will now recieve a warning
    stating that /usr/local is intended for non-managed files. (CNP-13)
  o A new policy, FixObsoletePaths, will now try to move files to the 
    correct place automatically, and log an error if it is unable to do so.
    The previous behaviour was for ObsoletePaths to log an error and not
    try to correct the issue. For compatability, an ObsoletePaths stub
    has been retained.
  o Manpages which contain their catagory in their filename will now be
    moved to the correct location if they exist in %(mandir)s and not
    %(mandir)s/category/. (CNP-5)
  o Manpages which were placed in directories such as /usr/share/man/1 will
    now be moved to their correct location: /usr/share/man/man1 (CNP-4)
  o Calling SharedLibrary with bad arguments will no longer cause a traceback.
    (CNP-45)

Changes in 1.0.9:
  o The AutoDoc policy now includes LICENSE.txt and NOTICE.txt files,
    since those names are common in Java packages. (CNP-29)
  o The NonMultilibComponent policy now considers only files, not
    directories. (CNP-39)
  o The NormalizeInitscriptContents policy now ignores directories.
    (CNP-41)

Changes in 1.0.8:
  o Enforce*BuildRequirements now provides some more explanation about
    what is wrong when dependencies are not resolved in the system
    database or within a package, and gives specific instructions about
    how to handle the common case where binaries are built incorrectly.
    (CNP-15)
  o The WarnWriteable policy now does not warn about group-writeable
    files if the group in question is "root". (CNP-24)
  o A bug that caused a traceback when attempting to make a symlink
    that points to the directory which contains it a relative symlink
    has been fixed. (CNP-28)

Changes in 1.0.7:
  o Enforce*BuildRequirements regular expression exceptions now
    function with the correct sense. (CNP-14)
  o A bug in NormalizePamConfig that would change pam files pointed
    to by symlinks in /etc/pam.d to have permissions 0777.  This would
    cause conary to fail to build the package.
  o A bug in Enforce*BuildRequirements that caused it to suggest
    overly aggressive and unnecessary build requirements, introduced
    in conary-policy 1.0.5, has been fixed. (CNP-12)

Changes in 1.0.6:
  o CheckSonames no longer suggests calling r.Ldconfig, because
    the NormalizeLibrarySymlinks policy will automatically take
    care of every case where CheckSonames could have suggested
    calling r.Ldconfig.
  o CheckSonames will warn about shared libraries that have a
    SONAME that matches the name of an actual file instead of a
    symlink only once, and it will print a more helpful message
    as information rather than as a warning.
  o A bug that caused the new interpreter checking behavior in
    EnforceBuildRequirements to traceback in many situations has
    been fixed.

Changes in 1.0.5:
  o Enforce*BuildRequirements now enforce that interpreters for
    scripts are listed as build requirements. (CNP-1)
  o Strip now raises an exception if debuginfo will fail because
    the buildPath was too short to modify path references in
    binary files.  Before, it silently disabled debuginfo.
  o Strip is no longer run for bootstrap builds, in order to ease
    debugging bootstrap builds.

Changes in 1.0.4:
  o NormalizePamConfig can now handle read-only /etc/pam.d files.

Changes in 1.0.3:
  o Enforce*BuildRequirements now take regular expressions for
    exceptions, as well as literal strings.
  o All suggested additions to buildRequires are coalesced via the
    reportMissingBuildRequires policy, when run with a Conary new
    enough to provide that policy (1.0.13 or later) (bz #869).
  o NormalizeLibrarySymlinks has a clearer message when ldconfig
    adds files to a directory, and the message is informational
    rather than a warning, since depending on NormalizeLibrarySymlinks
    instead of calling r.Ldconfig() explicitly is generally preferred.
  o DanglingSymlinks no longer reports all symbolic links as dangling
    symlinks when the buildpath contains a symbolic link (bz #856).

Changes in 1.0.2:
  o The warning previously generated for "bad RPATH entries" (that is,
    entries starting with the destdir, the builddir, /tmp, or /var/tmp)
    has been changed to an error.

Changes in 1.0.1:
  o CheckDesktopFiles now merely warns about missing icon files
    instead of raising an error; raising an error works very poorly
    because it adds too many false dependencies.
  o More policies have explicit ordering constraints added.
  o The documentation has been extensively updated.

Changes in 1.0:
  o Added the new PythonEggs policy which prevents packaging python
    .egg files and explains how to fix the problem.
  o Sped up EnforceConfigLogBuildRequirements for the case where there
    are no config.log files.
  o "Icon=" lines are now ignored in .desktop files.

Changes in 0.90.2:
  o Made the IgnoredSetuid policy work after ExcludeDirectories has
    been run.
  o DanglingSymlinks no longer complains if you add a symlink between 
    components where the source component requires the target

Changes in 0.90.1:
  o Added NormalizeInitscriptContents policy to fix bad paths in
    initscripts and add necessary dependencies on initscripts:runtime
  o Changed from debug to info level logging

Changes in 0.90.0 (initial version):
  o Split policy out from Conary
  o Note that conary-policy versions do not necessarily track Conary versions
