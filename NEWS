Changes in @NEW@:

Changes in 1.0.25:
  o Policies have been made capsule-aware and assume that the capsule
    will handle essentially all operations involving files in capsules.
    (PFM-506)
  o The RemoveBootstrapTroveDependencies policy removes trove dependencies
    that are not satisfied within the packages being built as a bootstrap
    because they may be computed against an incompatibly-named set of
    host packages. (PFM-506)
  o The PHPRequires policy now reports adding dependencies. (CNP-181)

Changes in 1.0.24:
  o Libraries (ELF files containing DT_SONAME entries, not symbolic
    links) with file names ending in .so (instead of .so.something)
    are now tagged as shared libraries. (CNP-175)
  o TagLocale no longer looks at files in %(debuglibdir)s or
    %(debugsrcdir)s, since it would only complain about them and
    ignore them anyway. (CNP-177)

Changes in 1.0.23:
  o A bug in SymlinkTargetRequires that caused a traceback when a
    symlink path contained a special regex character, such as +, has
    been fixed. (CNP-169)
  o The NormalizePythonInterpreterVersion policy has been modified to
    apply to all python scripts, regardless of whether they are
    executable, so that it applies to python modules as well as
    scripts. (CNP-170)
  o When moving info files, specify the full destination path; shutil.move
    has changed behavior in python 2.6 (CNP-173)
  o A bug in PHPRequires policy that caused builds to fail or take an
    extremely long time to complete when both php and php5 were available
    has been fixed. (CNP-174)

Changes in 1.0.22:
  o A bug causing PHPRequires to fail if buildRequires are not present
    in the repository has been fixed. (CNP-160)
  o PythonEggs now allows directories that end in .egg to be packaged.
    (CNP-148)
  o The NormalizePythonEggs has been added. It automatically unpacks
    python .egg files that are placed in standard python module locations.
    The resulting directory is put in place of the .egg file. (CNP-149)
  o The SymlinkTargetRequires policy has been added. This policy will
    supress the DanglingSymlinks policy in favor of adding requires when
    appropriate. (CNP-130)
  o The PHPRequires policy now caches negative results. (CNP-164)
  o The PHPRequires policy now looks for binaries named "php5" as well
    as "php".  Previous PHP5 handling looked only for packages named
    "php5" but still expected to see binaries named "php". (CNP-165)
  o The ResetKeyValueMetadata policy has been added. It selectively
    deletes certain key-value metadata fields. (CNY-2983)

Changes in 1.0.21:
  o A bug causing PHPRequires to fail in rMake has been fixed. (CNP-154)

Changes in 1.0.20:
  o The PHPRequires policy has been added.  It identifies PHP files and
    when possible automatically adds an appropriate requirement based
    on the most appropriate PHP interpreter found on your system,
    buildRequires, or installLabelPath. (CNY-145)

Changes in 1.0.19:
  o A bug causing NormalizeInitscriptContents to fail if the target of
    a symlink didn't exist has been fixed. (CNP-129)
  o A bug causing PkgConfigRequires to fail if the destdir is a symlink
    has been fixed (CNP-131).
  o RequireChkconfig has been modified to handle new style init scripts.
    It now warns instead of errors on failure. (CNP-109)
  o NormalizeInfoPages handles file magic better to cover corner cases.
    (CNP-135)
  o Setting a different prefix will no longer cause the Strip policy
    and several Normalize policies to traceback. (CNP-141)
  o The NormalizeLibrarySymlinks policy no longer attemps to run
    ldconfig from inside the package when cross-compiling. (CNP-140)
  o The EnforceStaticLibBuildRequirements policy now falls back to
    looking at shared libraries for cases where configure depends on
    a library existing, but only a shared library exists and no packaged
    file is linked against the shared library. (CNP-132)
  o The Strip policy no longer traces back if an ELF file is found but
    strip or eu-strip is not installed. (CNP-143)
  o The TagLocale policy has been added to tag locale files with a
    special path-derived tag of the form locale(localename). (CNP-138)

Changes in 1.0.18:
  o ConfigLogBuildRequirements caused builds to fail when encountering
    a line ending in "result:  " (two or more trailing spaces)
    while processing a config.log file.  This is corrected. (CNP-128)

Changes in 1.0.17:
  o Description and Licenses policies can now be used to set
    metadata information for troves. (CNY-2715)
  o The RequireChkconfig policy now accepts empty lines in the
    chkconfig header. (CNP-81)
  o The new HttpdConfigRequires policy adds dependencies on
    /usr/sbin/httpd for all /etc/httpd/conf.d/*.conf files. (CNP-110)
  o The FixObsoletePaths policy has been modified to run before
    AutoDoc. It will now delete empty Obsolete paths rather than
    attempting to move them. (CNP-70)
  o The RemoveNonPackageFiles policy has been modifed to run before
    most policies designed to Normalize filenames in order to reduce
    the occurrence of non-package files being masked. (CNP-122)
  o Moved VersionConflicts to from Conary to conary-policy and removed
    default exceptions. (CNY-2716)

Changes in 1.0.16:
  o Policies now work with more recent versions of Conary (2.0.12
    and later) so that Conary can warn about possibly excessive
    buildRequires elements. (CNY-2232)
  o The new EnforceLocalizationBuildRequirements policy warns that
    gettext:devel and intltool:runtime are required if POTFILES.in
    exists. (CNP-115)
  o The EnforceConfigLogBuildRequirements has been expanded to look
    for header files and static libraries mentioned in config.log
    files, as well as more binaries. (CNP-35, CNP-123)


Changes in 1.0.15:
  o The AutoSharedLibrary policy finds /etc/ld.so.conf.d/*.conf files
    and tells the SharedLibrary policy that the directories mentioned in
    those files contain shared libraries. (CNP-108)
  o Python *egg-info/requires.txt files are now inspected for suggested
    buildRequires additions. (CNP-102)
  o An error causing PkgConfigRequires to traceback when handling
    requirement paths involving symlinks has been fixed. (CNP-119)
  o The new EnforceStaticLibBuildRequirements policy examines the output
    of the build process for linking to libraries that are not included
    among the shared libraries required by the package but are included
    on the system, and suggests additional buildRequires for those
    libraries. (CNP-120)

Changes in 1.0.14:
  o Policies that move files in destdir now track path translations
    so files will end up in the correct package or component. (CNY-1679)
  o The XinetdConfigRequires policy has been added to enforce a requirement
    on xinetd when a configuration file with "disabled = no" is deployed
    in the /etc/xinetd.d/ directory. (CNP-93)
  o The PkgConfigRequires policy has been added to represent the
    internal dependencies expressed by pkg-config files. (CNP-93)

Changes in 1.0.13:
  o The EnforceCILBuildRequires policy now ensures that the build
    requirements include 'mono:devel' if there are any CIL dependencies
    found.  The mono:devel package is required to discover CIL
    dependencies. (CNP-91)
  o When determining build requirements based on dependencies, :devel
    or :devellib components are preferred to :lib components for all
    dependency types, not just soname: dependencies.
  o /usr/bin/gfortran is now accepted as a name for the fortran
    compiler when guessing about false positives in config.log
    output. (CNP-58)
  o Log-based buildRequires policies (for config.log and CMakeCache
    files) consider :devel, :devellib, and :lib as a set, choosing
    the best component to recommend in that order. (CNP-105)
  o The NormalizePythonInterpreterVersion policy now can be told
    to make specific version mappings that override its heuristics,
    which is necessary in particular to build multiple python
    versions which can co-exist on the same system. (CNP-104)

Changes in 1.0.12:
  o The _enforceBuildRequirements superclass now handles correctly
    having multiple packages with different names provide the same
    dependency required for a build requirement.  Previously, it
    only handled having multiple components of the same package
    provide the same dependency. (CNP-97)
  o The new NormalizePythonInterpreterVersion policy ensures that
    whenever possible, version-specific python interpreter paths
    are used. (CNP-99)
  o The NormalizeInitscriptContents no longer fails when a file in
    %(initdir)s is a link to a file outside of %(initdir)s. (CNP-101)
  o NormalizeInterpreterPaths now attempts to normalize more interpreter 
    paths - including those that look in /local/ for interpreters and 
    those that point to non-existant paths. (CNP-100)
  o The new EnforceCMakeCacheBuildRequirements policy recognizes
    potential buildRequirements based on CMakeCache.txt files as
    produced by the cmake tool.  Thanks to Pavel Volkovitskiy for
    implementing this feature. (CNP-67)

Changes in 1.0.11:
  o Initial support for derived packages (experimental) has been added
    to appropriate policies. (CNP-73)

Changes in 1.0.10:
  o The WorldWriteableExecutables policy warning message has been
    changed to be more accurate.
  o AutoDoc now enforces a mode of 0644 on files it adds to %(thisdocdir)s
    (CNP-43)
  o The new FixBuilddirSymlink policy has been added to fix symlinks
    that include the builddir. (CNP-48)
  o When multiple components provide a dependency that is discovered
    to be missing from the buildRequires list, dependencies between
    those components are investigated to determine which is the
    best dependency to suggest.  This will cause foo:devel to be
    suggested instead of providing a choice between foo:devel and
    foo:devellib. (CNP-60)
  o Now that Conary records the transitive closure of the buildRequires
    list, Enforce*BuildRequires inspects that transitive closure,
    eliminating unnecessary and redundant suggestions. (CNP-61)
  o The pam_stack module is now deprecated, so the NormalizePamConfig
    policy now changes to the preferred include mechanism by default.
    (CNP-42)
  o If Conary is new enough (1.0.41/1.1.14 or newer), Conary will now
    report if files that provide use flags are not included in the
    buildRequires list. (CNP-44)
  o All pkgconfig files are moved to be multilib-safe. (CNP-55)
  o Policy now fails on paths of /usr/usr (CNP-46).
  o Broken symlinks are now removed from the build dir after an error has
    been logged so that policies which check file contents are not confused
    by the broken symlink (CNP-59).
  o Packagers which place things into /usr/local will now recieve a warning
    stating that /usr/local is intended for non-managed files. (CNP-13)
  o A new policy, FixObsoletePaths, will now try to move files to the 
    correct place automatically, and log an error if it is unable to do so.
    The previous behaviour was for ObsoletePaths to log an error and not
    try to correct the issue. For compatability, an ObsoletePaths stub
    has been retained.
  o Manpages which contain their catagory in their filename will now be
    moved to the correct location if they exist in %(mandir)s and not
    %(mandir)s/category/. (CNP-5)
  o Manpages which were placed in directories such as /usr/share/man/1 will
    now be moved to their correct location: /usr/share/man/man1 (CNP-4)
  o Calling SharedLibrary with bad arguments will no longer cause a traceback.
    (CNP-45)

Changes in 1.0.9:
  o The AutoDoc policy now includes LICENSE.txt and NOTICE.txt files,
    since those names are common in Java packages. (CNP-29)
  o The NonMultilibComponent policy now considers only files, not
    directories. (CNP-39)
  o The NormalizeInitscriptContents policy now ignores directories.
    (CNP-41)

Changes in 1.0.8:
  o Enforce*BuildRequirements now provides some more explanation about
    what is wrong when dependencies are not resolved in the system
    database or within a package, and gives specific instructions about
    how to handle the common case where binaries are built incorrectly.
    (CNP-15)
  o The WarnWriteable policy now does not warn about group-writeable
    files if the group in question is "root". (CNP-24)
  o A bug that caused a traceback when attempting to make a symlink
    that points to the directory which contains it a relative symlink
    has been fixed. (CNP-28)

Changes in 1.0.7:
  o Enforce*BuildRequirements regular expression exceptions now
    function with the correct sense. (CNP-14)
  o A bug in NormalizePamConfig that would change pam files pointed
    to by symlinks in /etc/pam.d to have permissions 0777.  This would
    cause conary to fail to build the package.
  o A bug in Enforce*BuildRequirements that caused it to suggest
    overly aggressive and unnecessary build requirements, introduced
    in conary-policy 1.0.5, has been fixed. (CNP-12)

Changes in 1.0.6:
  o CheckSonames no longer suggests calling r.Ldconfig, because
    the NormalizeLibrarySymlinks policy will automatically take
    care of every case where CheckSonames could have suggested
    calling r.Ldconfig.
  o CheckSonames will warn about shared libraries that have a
    SONAME that matches the name of an actual file instead of a
    symlink only once, and it will print a more helpful message
    as information rather than as a warning.
  o A bug that caused the new interpreter checking behavior in
    EnforceBuildRequirements to traceback in many situations has
    been fixed.

Changes in 1.0.5:
  o Enforce*BuildRequirements now enforce that interpreters for
    scripts are listed as build requirements. (CNP-1)
  o Strip now raises an exception if debuginfo will fail because
    the buildPath was too short to modify path references in
    binary files.  Before, it silently disabled debuginfo.
  o Strip is no longer run for bootstrap builds, in order to ease
    debugging bootstrap builds.

Changes in 1.0.4:
  o NormalizePamConfig can now handle read-only /etc/pam.d files.

Changes in 1.0.3:
  o Enforce*BuildRequirements now take regular expressions for
    exceptions, as well as literal strings.
  o All suggested additions to buildRequires are coalesced via the
    reportMissingBuildRequires policy, when run with a Conary new
    enough to provide that policy (1.0.13 or later) (bz #869).
  o NormalizeLibrarySymlinks has a clearer message when ldconfig
    adds files to a directory, and the message is informational
    rather than a warning, since depending on NormalizeLibrarySymlinks
    instead of calling r.Ldconfig() explicitly is generally preferred.
  o DanglingSymlinks no longer reports all symbolic links as dangling
    symlinks when the buildpath contains a symbolic link (bz #856).

Changes in 1.0.2:
  o The warning previously generated for "bad RPATH entries" (that is,
    entries starting with the destdir, the builddir, /tmp, or /var/tmp)
    has been changed to an error.

Changes in 1.0.1:
  o CheckDesktopFiles now merely warns about missing icon files
    instead of raising an error; raising an error works very poorly
    because it adds too many false dependencies.
  o More policies have explicit ordering constraints added.
  o The documentation has been extensively updated.

Changes in 1.0:
  o Added the new PythonEggs policy which prevents packaging python
    .egg files and explains how to fix the problem.
  o Sped up EnforceConfigLogBuildRequirements for the case where there
    are no config.log files.
  o "Icon=" lines are now ignored in .desktop files.

Changes in 0.90.2:
  o Made the IgnoredSetuid policy work after ExcludeDirectories has
    been run.
  o DanglingSymlinks no longer complains if you add a symlink between 
    components where the source component requires the target

Changes in 0.90.1:
  o Added NormalizeInitscriptContents policy to fix bad paths in
    initscripts and add necessary dependencies on initscripts:runtime
  o Changed from debug to info level logging

Changes in 0.90.0 (initial version):
  o Split policy out from Conary
  o Note that conary-policy versions do not necessarily track Conary versions
