Changes in 1.0.3:
  o Enforce*BuildRequirements now take regular expressions for
    exceptions, as well as literal strings.
  o All suggested additions to buildRequires are coalesced via the
    reportMissingBuildRequires policy, when run with a Conary new
    enough to provide that policy (1.0.13 or later) (bz #869).
  o NormalizeLibrarySymlinks has a clearer message when ldconfig
    adds files to a directory, and the message is informational
    rather than a warning, since depending on NormalizeLibrarySymlinks
    instead of calling r.Ldconfig() explicitly is generally preferred.

Changes in 1.0.2:
  o The warning previously generated for "bad RPATH entries" (that is,
    entries starting with the destdir, the builddir, /tmp, or /var/tmp)
    has been changed to an error.

Changes in 1.0.1:
  o CheckDesktopFiles now merely warns about missing icon files
    instead of raising an error; raising an error works very poorly
    because it adds too many false dependencies.
  o More policies have explicit ordering constraints added.
  o The documentation has been extensively updated.

Changes in 1.0:
  o Added the new PythonEggs policy which prevents packaging python
    .egg files and explains how to fix the problem.
  o Sped up EnforceConfigLogBuildRequirements for the case where there
    are no config.log files.
  o "Icon=" lines are now ignored in .desktop files.

Changes in 0.90.2:
  o Made the IgnoredSetuid policy work after ExcludeDirectories has
    been run.
  o DanglingSymlinks no longer complains if you add a symlink between 
    components where the source component requires the target

Changes in 0.90.1:
  o Added NormalizeInitscriptContents policy to fix bad paths in
    initscripts and add necessary dependencies on initscripts:runtime
  o Changed from debug to info level logging

Changes in 0.90.0 (initial version):
  o Split policy out from Conary
  o Note that conary-policy versions do not necessarily track Conary versions
