    NAME
    ====

    B{C{r.VersionConflicts()}} - Prevents multiple versions of a trove from
    the same branch from being cooked into a group.

    SYNOPSIS
    ========

    C{r.VersionConflicts([I{filterexp}] || [I{exceptions=filterexp}])}

    DESCRIPTION
    ===========

    The C{r.VersionConflicts} policy enforces that two troves with different
    versions cannot come from the same branch. This situation commonly occurs
    when the current group consumes an upstream group, and they both refer to
    a trove without being explicit about the version to use.

    If an inclusion of exception is passed as a string, it will be converted
    to a trove filter object, treating the string as the name regexp. Trove
    filters can be combined with boolean algebra or bitwise logical operators.

    This policy is an image group policy. Please see GroupRecipe for more
    information.

    EXAMPLES
    ==========

    r.VersionConflicts(exceptions = 'foo')

    Any trove named exactly foo will be ignored for this policy.

    r.VersionConflicts(exceptions = 'group-compat32')

    Any trove inside of group-compat32 will be ignored for this policy.

    fooFilter = r.troveFilter('foo.*', version = 'foo.rpath.org@rpl:1')
    groupFilter = r.troveFilter('group-core')
    r.VersionConflicts(exceptions = fooFilter & groupFilter)

    Any trove that starts with foo on the foo.rpath.org@rpl:1 label in
    group-core will be ignored.

    fooFilter = r.troveFilter('foo.*', flavor = 'is: x86')
    groupFilter = r.troveFilter('group-core')
    r.VersionConflicts(exceptions = fooFilter & -groupFilter)

    Any trove in group-core that does not match fooFilter will be ignored for
    this policy. Effectively this means that foo[is: x86] will be considered,
    but no other trove in group-core.
